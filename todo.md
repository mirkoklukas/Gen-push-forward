**Todos, ideas etc...**

- `HeterogeneousMixture` doesn't work because it doesn't know about push-forwards... 
- Define a type `ForwardFunction` or `PushFunction` containing $f,g,\det(df)$, we could then use the syntax `Q = f(P)`, or `Q = f*P` as in the discrete case for dictionaries?
- Define types along the lines of `DifferentiablePushForward` and `DiscretePushForward`?
